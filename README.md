# Amstrad CPC Rom Hacks
Just a repository of scripts for working with Amstrad CPC Roms

All files are Python3

If you have requests or bug reports, please open [a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/cormacj/AmstradCPCRomHacks/issues/new)

## romdetails.py

This script will display the name, version and command list for a ROM, including any hidden commands, meaning any that can only be called from code.

Some roms have a really disordered list of commands that make it hard to find a given command, so I added a -c option that only displays the commands so that these can be easily sorted with another command.

```
romdetails.py v2.51

Usage:
This will display the RSX commands (if any) available in a ROM:
romdetails.py ./SourceROM.rom


Examples:
	./romdetails.py TestROM.rom
	Rom type: Background
	Version:  1.21

	TESTROM
	RSX1
	RSX2
	Hidden Command: 0x0
	Hidden Command: 0x1

-h or --help - this message
-c or --commandonly - only list the commands
-w or --wiki - output the commands in a wikitable format, suitable for pasting into a wiki
```
The script will also decode Graduate Software Accessory ROMS:
```
./romdetails.py ./CPM_Plus_Acc_1.rom
Rom type: Graduate Software CP/M Accessory ROM
Name:	  Graduate (C)1988
	  CP/M Accessory Rom 1
Version:  VER 2.30
Apps:
NSWEEP
FORMAT
PCW
RUN
UNERA
D
```
## dum.py

  This dumps a .ROM file showing any printable ascii characters and strings.
  There are two options parameters that can be used.

  -x <xor value> This is useful for looking at the encoded information in Graduate Software CPM+ roms.
```
  Usage: dum.py romfile.rom -x <xor hex value>
  Example: dum.py CPM1.rom -x 0x4e
    Known XOR values are:
      0xaa - password
      0x4e - name, address, serial etc
```
  Usage: dum.py romfile.rom -o <offset value>
     This is useful if you are reverse engineering a ROM and want to know where strings occur. Roms usually start at 0xC000
  Example: dum.py CPM1.ROM -o 0xc000

## cpmrompatch.py

This was written for patching Graduate Software CPM+ roms. For more details see here: https://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Graduate_Software

This patches the first CPM rom so you can use your own name, address, password etc
```
Usage:
To display the details of what is stored in the ROM:
  cpmrompatch.py --src SourceROM.rom --display

To update the ROM, you must specify --src and --dest and one of the following:
  cpmrompatch.py --src SourceROM.rom --dest DestROM.rom
    --quiet - Disable the noisy, large default ROM boot message and replace it with a short version
    --name "<Name>" - Sets the name of the ROM owner
    --address "<Address>" - Sets the address of the ROM owner
    --serial <serial number> - Sets the serial number of the ROM
    --password <password> - Sets the password for |PASSWORD

You can also just pass a filename and it will display the details for that ROM
  eg cpmrompatch.py CPM1.ROM

Examples:
   cpmrompatch.py --src CPM1.rom --dest CPM1-updated.rom --name "John Smith" --address "123 Acacia Ave, Sometown"
```

## make_accessory_rom.py
This script will build an accessory ROM for use with the Graduate Software CP/M roms.. It can also extract a .COM file from a prebuilt ROM file.

The name of the ROM file is required.

If you are extracting a .COM using `-e` then all the other possible arguments will be ignored if supplied.

```
usage: ./make_accessory_rom.py [-h] [-i "ROM ID String"] [-n "ROM Description"] [-v "ROM Version string"] [-e [filename, or blank for all files ...]] ROM_filename [.COM_file ...]

This is a utility to build accessory ROMs for Amstrad Graduate Software CP/M ROMs

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Required:
  A name for a ROM file is required

  ROM_filename          This is the name of the ROM file that you are creating.

Building:
  These options relate to building a ROM

  .COM_file             This must be a CP/M program.
  -i "ROM ID String", --id "ROM ID String"
                        ROM Identification. It must start with G, and be no more than 16 characters. The default is "Grad ROM 06/2024"
  -n "ROM Description", --name "ROM Description"
                        This is the name that will be shown in commands such as |OHELP or romcat. It must be no more than 32 characters.
  -v "ROM Version string", --romversion "ROM Version string"
                        This is a string that will dictate the version of the rom.

Extracting:
  These options relate to extracting files from a ROM

  -e [filename, or blank for all files ...], --extract [filename, or blank for all files ...]
                        Extract files from a ROM.

Note: -e can only be used by itself and not with any other argument.

Examples:
  To recreate the original accessory rom:
    ./make_accessory_rom.py CPM_ACC1.ROM NSWEEP.COM FORMAT.COM PCW.COM RUN.COM UNERA.COM D.COM -i "Graduate (C)1988" -n "CP/M Accessory Rom 1" -v "VER 2.30 "

  Extract PCW.COM from CPM_ACC1.ROM:
    ./make_accessory_rom.py CPM_ACC1.ROM -e PCW
````
## headertool.py
This tool will remove AMSDOS headers from files for use with emulators.

Sometimes files are uploaded to sites with the AMSDOS 128 byte header intact and this causes the file to not work in an emuator. This tool removes that header and writes a new copy.

```
A tool to remove AMSDOS headers from an image.

Usage: headertool.py source.rom destination.rom -n <size of header to remove>
   -n is optional, defaults to 0x80

Example:
headertool.py CPM1.rom CPM1-fixed.rom -n 0x7f

```
